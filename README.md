spring-boot-experiment
======================

* `./gradlew run` - runs the app
* `./gradlew bootRun` - runs the app (what's the difference?)
* `./gradlew distZip` - builds a zip package the `application` plugin would have built (what's the difference?)
* `./gradlew bootRepackage` - builds an executable uber-jar (run with `java -jar xxx.jar`)
